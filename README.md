# LinkedIn-Graph
This algorithm to determine the shortest path in graph using an exhaustive iterative backtracking Depth-first search (DFS). 


Here is an example of a data input file (this is the graph):

The first line of the file will contain an integer indicating how many rows of data will
be in the file. Each subsequent row will contain two individualâ€™s names separated
with a pipe (shift-\ on most keyboards).

Output File

A sample input file for requested minimum connection distance is shown below. .
The first line will contain an integer indicating the number of input lines in this file.
The subsequent lines will contain a pipe-delimited list of individual pairs separated
by a pipe. 


The output file should have n + m lines of output where n is the number
of unique individuals in the system (the number of nodes) and m is the number of
requested pairs for which min distance is requested.


The program will run command line with the
following arguments:
./linkedin -r <ConnectionsDatafile> <RequestedConnections>
<OutputFile>

Alternatively, the program will run the Tests for dynamic memory allocation of they LinkedList, Stack, and Adjacency List if is is called with the following argument:
./linkedin -t
